# VS Code Language Model (VSLM) Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating VS Code Language Model capabilities into our extension.

## Requirements

[TO BE FILLED BASED ON TEAM INPUT]

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new `VsCodeLmService` that will handle all VSLM-related operations.
2. Implement unit tests for the `VsCodeLmService`.
3. Update the `Cline` class to use the `VsCodeLmService` with minimal changes.
4. Implement integration tests for the VSLM functionality.
5. Update the UI to include VSLM-related options and information.

## Constraints

- Minimize changes to existing core files, especially `Cline.ts`.
- Ensure all new functionality is thoroughly tested before integration.
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing features.

## Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for all new VSLM-related functions.
- Create integration tests that verify the interaction between VSLM and existing functionality.
- Implement end-to-end tests for user-facing VSLM features.

## Timeline

[TO BE DETERMINED]

## Open Questions

- What specific VSLM capabilities are we integrating?
- Are there any performance considerations we need to account for?
- How will this integration affect the existing API providers?
